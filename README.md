# EmiTech

The modpack that https://github.com/Sencres013/EmiTech/ points to.
This pack is downloaded via the updater script above in order to provide updates within the MultiMC instance folder, upon launching the game.

The .gitignore is necessary to ensure the script does not stash necessary files the script needs to function.

Anybody is free to download this pack and/or its updater, if desired.
As mentioned in the updater repository, users are allowed to configure it for their own purposes.
